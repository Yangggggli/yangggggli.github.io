# Introduction

I am now a student at [UCAS] (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences). I am a beginner in mathematics. My interests lie in pure mathematics, including:

- number theory or arithmetic geometry(class field theory, Kronecker's Jugendtraum, elliptic curves, modular form, Galois representation, complex multiplication, cohomological interpretations, Langlands, rigid geometry, Tate conjecture, motive)
- algebraic geometry(Riemann surface, Kähler manifold, Hodge theory, descent theory, abelian variety, moduli, GIT)
- symplectic geometry(HMS, microlocalization)
- geometric representation(Springer theory, D-module, geometric Langlands)
- basic backgrounds in analysis, topology and differential geometry
I’ve came to the land for about just one year so I have not learnt much, but I am determined to learn through those topics I love and hope to reach some interesting results in the future.
I’m now planning on learning Weil conjecture(Deligne’s 1-st proof first) to receive a better understanding of cohomology, there may be some notes in the future.

My name is Jason Ansel.  I am a Director of Engineering at GoDaddy, which
I joined in 2013 as part of the [acquisition] of the startup [Locu][locu].
I started working for Locu in 2011, while I was simultaneously pursuing
my PhD at [MIT][MIT] [CSAIL][CSAIL], which I completed in 2013.  I was the
first non-founder employee of Locu and my work there and at GoDaddy focuses
on creating machine learning algorithms for extracting semantic information
from unstructured web content.

I spend some of my free time working on [OpenTuner], an extensible framework
for program autotuning.  We are currently looking for users, if interested
the source code is available on the [OpenTuner] site.

As part of my PhD dissertation, I started the [PetaBricks] language and
compiler project.  PetaBricks is a language that incorporates algorithmic
choices to allow an integrated autotuner to explore search spaces of program
implementations.  As an undergraduate I did research with [Gene Cooperman]
and helped create [DMTCP], a user-level distributed checkpoint/restart system. -->
